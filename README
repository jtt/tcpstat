 ABOUT

 tcpstat is a simple program which can be used to monitor active TCP
 connections. Think about a cross between 'top' and 'netstat'. 

 Tcpstat is written in C and uses ncurses for UI. While still pretty much under
 the development, the program has reached a state where it might actually be
 usefull. If it only had proper help and man pages. 

 LICENSING 

 The program is licensed under two-clause BSD license. 

 BUILDING and INSTALLING

 Edit the Makefile to suit your needs. Type 'make' optionally followed by 'make
 install'

 If you want to enable the debug information, edit src/defs.h and remove
 comments around #define DEBUG. Then rebuild the application. If built with
 debugging enabled, the program will write debug information to file debug.txt.

 RUNNING 

 The program has '--help' option which should provide some information on the
 available command line parameters.
