 *
 * @section About

 tcpstat is a simple program which can be used to monitor active TCP
 connections. Think about a cross between 'top' and 'netstat'. 

 Tcpstat is written in C and uses ncurses for UI. While still pretty much under
 the development, the program has reached a state where it might actually be
 usefull. If it only had proper help and man pages.
